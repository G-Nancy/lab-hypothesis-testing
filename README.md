# Lab | Hypothesis Testing

## Introduction

In `main.ipynb` we'll familiarize you with one sample hypothesis tests. You will write Python code to conduct one sample hypothesis tests. There is also an OPTIONAL exercise on hypothesys testing for proportion sampling: when your obeservations all are either 1 or 0 and what you want to estimate is the percentage of occurence of 1s.

Despite the name, you also must complete `bonus.ipynb` (the name is an unfortunate legacy that allows the AI grader to work) where you will learn about two types of t-tests: Student's t- and Paired t- tests.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` (required)
- `bonus.ipynb` (required)

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
